# matplotlib-challenge

In the Matplotlib Challenge, I was the the Data Analyst for Pymaceuticals Inc., a pharamaceutical company, and was given data to analyze and interpret. 

Pymaceuticals Inc. performed an animal study, where 250 mice were treated through different drug regimes over the course of 45 days. The purpose of this challenge was to analyze four different types of drug regimes and to compare them.

First, I cleaned and re-constructed the dataset. Then, I created a scatter plot of the four treatments: Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo comparing the different tumor volume (in mm3) changes over time (in days). It seemed that Capomulin's tumor volume significantly decreased over time, while for the other three treatments, tumor volume change over time increased gradually. The treatment Ketapril increased the most out of the three that increased. 

Then,
